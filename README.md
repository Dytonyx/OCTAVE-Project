# This was a project I had done in college for my risk management class. There are many risk management frameworks to work with, but ultimately, the professor went 
with the OCTAVE method developed at Carenegie Mellon University. The approach was able to look at a risk management through a macro and micro lens, with knowledge 
gained being applicable to risk frameworks a student may come across in the future. The project was to explore a hypothetical company called H.R. Swisher Manufacturing 
Incorporated and develop a detailed analysis of the risks towards the company and possible solutions. The Word file is 300+ pages so it make take some time to render 
the entire document.
